## Short description

### What's the problem?

The business problem that we are taking up is that in the current situation, when social distancing is a must and people are out of work and facing challenges related to procurement of essential commodities, the government has come up with variety of schemes to provide necessary food items to the needy people in the society. But currently there is no  way to  ensure that the benefits reach the people by avoiding direct contact and also migrant workers does not have facility to avail the government scheme in a different state. 

The problem stated above is a genuine one where we have seen many reports in the news where the people are actually not able to get the benefits even though the government has announced the scheme and is working on that. 

### How can technology help?

The solution we suggest includes a vending machine and a mobile application that would help us identify the individual and the benefits he is eligible for and then we can send an instruction to the vending machine to vend that much quantity of food grains. This way we can have a digital database to track the individuals who had benefitted directly and also we can remove the middle man benefitting by hoarding of grains and providing wrong measurements of food grains.
